# ForeCastor

## Why the typo?
Yes it’s a typo, but it’s a typo with a purpose. It’s a playful nod to the mythological twins, 
**Castor** and Pollux. These two heroes were inseparable, known for their adventures, including the 
rescue of Helen of Troy. Alone, they were impressive, but together, they were unstoppable. 
This myth resonates with the essence of our app. In the world of supply chain demand forecasting, the 
final forecast often consists of two parts: a statistical or machine learning baseline and manual 
enrichments. Just like Castor and Pollux, both elements need to work in harmony to achieve effective 
demand planning. Yes, it's a bit cheesy, but hey, who doesn't love a good mythological reference?

## Where can you use the app for?
