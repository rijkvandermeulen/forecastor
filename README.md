## Why this app?
Most organizations measure the quality (i.e., forecast accuracy and bias) of the end result of the demand planning process; 
often referred to as the “final” or “consensus” forecast. However, these metrics alone don’t capture the value added 
throughout the process. For instance, you might be satisfied with an 80% forecast accuracy, but if the baseline 
forecast accuracy was 85%, you’ve invested valuable time and resources only to diminish the forecast quality. 
This example highlights the importance of tracking the Forecast Value Add (FVA) of enrichment: that is, to what 
extent are demand planners improving the baseline forecast. 

Monitoring only the FVA, however, isn’t enough. Imagine a scenario where the FVA is 10 percentage points, 
indicating that demand planners are excelling at improving the baseline forecast. Does this mean the overall demand 
planning process is flawless? Not necessarily. It might be that your forecast engine is underperforming; leading demand 
planners to spend considerable effort on enrichments that a higher-quality forecast engine could have handled 
more efficiently. In other words, if the forecasting engine were better, the planners wouldn’t need to spend as 
much time on adjustments. This example emphasizes the need to also evaluate the quality of your forecast engine by 
comparing it to a simple benchmark (e.g., by comparing the forecast accuracy of your forecast engine to a 
naïve forecast). 

In short, to assess the effectiveness of our overall demand planning process, we must evaluate the 
quality of all the individual components. This app aims to provide a simple and intuitive way to do just that.

## Where can I find the app?
The app is hosted on Koyeb and can be accessed [here](https://corresponding-ynez-rvdm-ead8c59e.koyeb.app/).
Note, the intended use for this app is for demonstration purposes and not for processing and analyzing big datasets. 
That being said, have fun playing around with it!

## Why the typo?
Yes it’s a typo, but it’s a typo with a purpose. It’s a playful nod to the mythological twins, 
**Castor** and Pollux. These two heroes were inseparable, known for their adventures, including the 
rescue of Helen of Troy. Alone, they were impressive, but together, they were unstoppable. 
This myth resonates with the essence of our app. In the world of supply chain demand forecasting, the 
final forecast often consists of two parts: a statistical or machine learning baseline and manual 
enrichments. Just like Castor and Pollux, both elements need to work in harmony to achieve effective 
demand planning. Yes, it's a bit cheesy, but hey, who doesn't love a good mythological reference?
